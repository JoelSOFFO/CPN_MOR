This is the implementation of the method proposed in [1] https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.05088

The code relies on the library tensap [2], and features implementations of compositional polynomial networks, with sparse 
approximation (CPN-S) or low-rank approximation (CPN-LR). It also contains implementations of the different manifold approximation methods 
used for comparisons in [3, 4, 5].

To use the code : 
- Clone the repository

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/JoelSOFFO/CPN_MOR.git
  cd CPN_MOR
  ```
  
- Install the package tensap, see https://github.com/anthony-nouy/tensap

- Install the required libraries

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
- Data format: data is given as a numpy array of shape (D, m), whoses columns represent m samples in R^D.
    It is given in a npy file whose path is given in config files (cpn.yaml and sota.yaml).
  
- To run CPN, use the command line

  ```
  python3 CPN_MOR.py --config_path configs/cpn.yaml --mode choose_a_mode 
  ```

  - The parameters of the method can be changed in the config file cpn.yaml.
  - There are 3 modes available :  "--mode train", "--mode test" and "--mode plot" for respectively training the model, testing it, or plotting the 
  compositional networks (graphs) of some indices (The indices must be defined in "indices_to_plot" in the config file).

  
- To run the other methods used in the article, use the command line

  ```
    python3 sota_MOR.py --config_path configs/sota.yaml 
  ```

  - The parameters related to these methods can be changed in the config file sota.yaml.
